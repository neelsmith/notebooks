# Interactive notebooks and shells

Documented working examples of various notebook configurations for Scala and Scala+Spark.   The goal is to create a  sort of Rosetta code-like collection for a single test case requiring:

- add a personal bintray repository to the list of resolvers
- define a dependency on a library from the added resolver
- import and use a class from the added dependency
- compute a histogram of tokens in a citable corpus
- graph the histogram

## TBD


### Interactive environments

Some environments I'd like to try and document:

- Scala Jupyter notebooks on github and binder
- Almond kernel:  <https://brunk.io/interactive-computing-in-scala-with-jupyter-and-almond.html>
- BeakerX
- Zeppelin
- Hydrogen from within Atom
- Ammonite shell


### Graphics

- Zeppelin
- plotly
- evilplot
